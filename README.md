# IDAsg

This project is for my ID Assignment 1, it is a website made for fans of Japanese Singer/Songwriter Kenshi Yonezu.

Design Process

It is to be used for easy access to his songs and merchandise, as well as an About page so visitors can learn more about him.

As a fan, I want to know any important news about this music artist, hence news should be on the front page.

As a customer, I want to purchase merchandise or albums, hence access to these pages must be on the front page and/or easy to access.

As a curious visitor, I want to know more about this music artist, hence access to the about page or discography page must be easy to access.
